An Android library that provides the ability to mock your final classes
on Android devices.

## Installation

```groovy
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

repositories {
    google()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    androidTestImplementation 'com.github.tmurakami:dexopener:2.0.5'

    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:runner:x.y.z'

    // DexOpener is also usable together with the ATSL runner.
    // androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:runner:x.y.z'
}
```

## Usage

Add an `AndroidJUnitRunner` subclass into your app's **androidTest**
directory.

```java
// Specify your root package as `package` statement.
// The final classes you can mock are only in the package and its subpackages.
package your.root.pkg;

public class YourAndroidJUnitRunner extends AndroidJUnitRunner {
    @Override
    public Application newApplication(ClassLoader cl, String className, Context context)
            throws ClassNotFoundException, IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException {
        DexOpener.install(this); // Call me first!
        return super.newApplication(cl, className, context);
    }
}
```

Then specify your `AndroidJUnitRunner` as the default test
instrumentation runner in your app's build.gradle.

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16 // 16 or higher
        testInstrumentationRunner 'your.root.pkg.YourAndroidJUnitRunner'
    }
}
```

You can see some examples [here](examples).

## Tips

### Replacing the Application instance for testing

To instantiate your custom `android.app.Application` object other than
default application, pass a string literal of that class name as the
second argument to `super.newApplication()` in your test instrumentation
runner.

```java
@Override
public Application newApplication(ClassLoader cl, String className, Context context)
        throws ClassNotFoundException, IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException {
    DexOpener.install(this); // Call me first!
    return super.newApplication(cl, "your.root.pkg.YourTestApplication", context);
}
```

**Do not call `Class#getName()` to get your Application class name**.
The following code may cause an `IllegalAccessError` saying `Class ref
in pre-verified class ...`.

```java
return super.newApplication(cl, YourTestApplication.class.getName(), context);
````

## Alternatives

### [Kotlin all-open compiler plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#all-open-compiler-plugin)

DexOpener will do the following things at runtime:

1. Remove the final modifier from the classes belonging to the specified package
1. Create dex files to make the application class loader load those classes

However, they are not so lightweight. If you would like to save even a
little testing time of your Kotlin app, you can introduce
[the all-open compiler plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#all-open-compiler-plugin)
instead of DexOpener.

[This article](https://proandroiddev.com/mocking-androidtest-in-kotlin-51f0a603d500)
would be helpful to know how to open Kotlin classes with that plugin
only for testing.

### [Dexmaker](https://github.com/linkedin/dexmaker)

You can now even stub the final methods of the Android API using
`dexmaker-mockito-inline` library. In addition,
`dexmaker-mockito-inline-extended` library supports for stubbing static
methods and spying on an object created by the Android system such as
Activity.
[Here](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/mock-final-and-static-methods-on-android-devices-b383da1363ad)
is an introduction article.

Note that these libraries will only work with Android 9+.

### [MockK](https://mockk.io/)

MockK provides inline mocking feature derived from Dexmaker. You would
be able to mock the final classes by using `mockk-android` library. That
feature is automatically enabled with Android 9+. You can see the
supported features
[here](https://github.com/mockk/mockk/blob/master/ANDROID.md).

By checking `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` in your test instrumentation runner,
you can switch that feature and DexOpener according to the OS version of
the testing device. See the test instrumentation runner in
[the `mockk` example](examples/mockk).

## Notice

DexOpener contains the classes of the following libraries:

- [dexlib2 (part of smali/baksmali)](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali)
- [Guava (on which dexlib2 relies)](https://github.com/google/guava)

They have been minified with
[ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard) and repackaged with
[Jar Jar Links](https://github.com/pantsbuild/jarjar).
